## Summary of Hours

### I started working on this project alone in July 2022 as part of Web3athon which was a 2 month long hackathon and one of the biggest multi-chain hackathons in the 
### world. I was invited to New York since it was a winner and a standout project. Since then, I have continued working on it to develop a proof of concept. This is a long
### term project, and will continue even after I graduate. Since I worked alone and achieved all these milestones, along with working as a research assistant at the new
### Crypto-Econ lab, that should justify my commitment and hours to this project. I was working at a pace of about 10 hours/week leaving senior design tasks aside.
