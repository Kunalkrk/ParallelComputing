## Description

### In the United States, workers saw a decrease in the purchasing power of their wages by 4 percent over the last year. Despite the nominal increase in dollar-nominated wages of 5 percent, inflation rates of 9 percent pulled down real wages and harmed economic growth. Businesses struggled to retain quality workers because their employees often left for other companies that offered higher nominal wages.

### The web3 native payroll product, realCashFlow, offers a solution to inflation’s harmful effects on workers by paying them daily in inflation-adjusted dollars. Workers no longer have the strong desire to leave their company for higher wages since they know that their wages are automatically adjusted by a real-time blockchain oracle, Truflation. In addition, workers who receive their compensation on a daily basis are able to immediately invest their savings, producing accelerated investment returns.

### Businesses can rely on realCashFlow to deliver 24/7 payments at nearly instant speeds at extremely low costs. By paying wages in the blockchain-native USDC on the Circle platform, businesses can operate more profitably. realCashFlow also relies on a censorship-resistant data feed of real-time inflation data which allows the businesses to customize their inflation index by geography and employee purchasing patterns.

### As a business, realCashFlow offers a compelling investment for outside funding because realCashFlow clients prefund their account in advance of a traditional payroll period. The realCashFlow platform invests these funds in a product like Circle Yield, in order to generate a return to offset inflation costs and the product’s own fees.
